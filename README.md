## Hello, this project builds an UI with Java GUI toolkits - Swing & AWT, to simulate the dynamic process of a tree growing. 


### Features include:
1. Different rules to support growing of trees in various shapes
2. Control panel to select a growth mode and control the tree growing


### Sample outputs:
> <img src="./out_samples/Tree1.png" alt="tree1" width="300" height="400">
> <img src="./out_samples/Tree2.png" alt="tree2" width="300" height="400">
> <img src="./out_samples/Tree3.png" alt="tree3" width="300" height="400">
> <img src="./out_samples/TreeRandom.png" alt="tree random" width="300" height="400">
